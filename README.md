## Project Description

This is a passion project. I love making beats and music consisting of Lofi, Soul, Hip-Hop and Alternative using FL Studio Mobile. Ever since I was young, I loved playing the drums and music in general, so I eventually drifted to making music digitally. Also, I am very fascinated with Web Development, so I decided to combine two of my interests, and make my own music-streaming service! 

The website consists of my own music, along with beats using music I sampled and interpolated (See Credits below). I made the website from scratch using Vue JS, honing my skills with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and exploring different things I have not learned in my Web Development course at university, like the use of Firebase Cloud Storage to reference my songs for the music player, audio file manipulation, and the like.
